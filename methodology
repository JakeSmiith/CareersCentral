Missing observations: 
Removed Vacancy ID, myCC StudentView, position, employer, employer ID
when did they start running wecan as a tag? 
No data on clicks until cell 5343 - cannot run regression analysis until 2nd January 2020 (No job listings on NYD)
Removing all countries except UK
'WeCan not implemented until 25th March 2022 - so removed all cells before 21st March 2022 (Assuming mgt decision made on the Monday)
Username , UserID dropped - However, for employee monitoring, a dataset including this in the future would be very useful
Removed all regions except the United Kingdom - Degrees of freedom too small to make a meaningful comparison
Weird cells - Do I remove or change? Probably remove for simplicity and time efficiency
Cell 4363 - Gives UK towns, but placed as Ireland 
Removed expiry date

Do we keep academic year?
- Keeping academic year - Helps track long-term trends, helps idntify whether job listing receive more engagement over multiple hiring cycles. 
- Keeping publish date - Recruitment cycles vary - exact publication date is critical since interest in job listings fluctuate over time. 

Econometric model 
- Define the panel structure (see word doc)
- Doesn't have firm-fixed effects - How do we get around this (Employee size) - Could look at each employer, and then create my own variable? - This will take some time. 

Which econometric model do I use?
- Sensitivity analysis with model type (Start with baseline - OLS panel with fixed effects, then Poisson/negative binomial as clicks are count data, then heterogeneous effects model, then IV model?)
- How do I construct the NLP in R? This will probably be a session from home. 
- Number of positons - is this available to students when applying? 

- Renumeration
- Do I normalise values? 

Positions valued 'competitive' - Put NA temporarily - Or could research the salary
